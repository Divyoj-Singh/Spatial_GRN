This document entails the details of what goes in the third figure. This figure is exclusively for toggle triad.

The following plots need are to be uploaded.

1. Schematic - Graph/Node diagram for the toggle triad scheme. Include diffusion in the same.
2. Dynamics of a tristable network.
    
    1. IC Dependent ?

3.  Bifurcation Diagram in tristability @Navin
4. Time taken to reach steady state @Navin
5. 1D Diffusion 

    1. Different Stability Regimes

6. 2D Diffusion @Chinmay

    1. Snapshots for Mono, Bi and Tristable Cases
    2. Movies for the same with Different Diffusions

7. Extras

    1. Hexastable Dynamics and Plots
    2. Monostable Oscillator

Notes:
1. Other detrails of the toggle triad can be added here.
